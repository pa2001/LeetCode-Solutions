logic:first you need to check the length of the two strings if they aren't equal then append 0's at the start of the shorter string to have same length.
then you need to add. For that you need to initialise two variables sum and carry where sum will calculate the sum of character and carry will check if sum > 9.
you need to start from the last most bit as you do in maths rest code is self explanatory.
